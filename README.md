# Continuous Integration

This project is dedicated to share documentation about Continuous Integration process.

### What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.

## [Continuous Integration on AWS](ContinuousIntegrationSetup.md)

This aims to explain how AWS CodePipeline, one of the services offered by AWS platform, works to configure a Continuous Delivery workflow. As well as giving an overview of concepts such as Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment.
